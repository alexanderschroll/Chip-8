# Chip-8
🕹️ A Chip-8 emulator written in Python 3!

> [Chip-8][1] is a simple, interpreted, programming language which was first used on some do-it-yourself computer systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

## Motivation

My main motivation is to increase familiarity with the Python 3 language and to learn lower level programming concepts.

Here are only some concepts I learned while writing this emulator:
- How to disassemble and decode an opcode into instructions a CPU can use
 - How a CPU can utilise memory, stack, program counters, stack pointers, memory addresses, and registers
- How a CPU implements fetch, decode, and execute
## Key Mapping
This dictionary is organised to resemble the 1977 COSMAC VIP's keyboard which had a 16-key hexadecimal keypad.
