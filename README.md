🕹️ A Chip-8 emulator written in Python 3!

> [Chip-8][1] is a simple, interpreted, programming language which was first used on some do-it-yourself computer systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

## Motivation

My main motivation is to increase familiarity with the Python 3 language and to learn lower level programming concepts.
